# CartoonGAN
This is a tensorflow implementation of Cartoon GAN published in CVPR2018 (http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Chen_CartoonGAN_Generative_Adversarial_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf). The network is loosely based on the paper but has a few changes: input size is 96*96(256*256 in original paper), patch size for discriminator is 28*28(70*70 in original paper), less channels and stacked residual blocks for generator and discriminator network, different hyperparameters.
In this implementation, we use celeba dataset for real person images and getchu dataset (https://github.com/shaform/GirlsManifold) for cartoon style images. All images were center cropped into square shape and then resized to 96*96. For the edge-blured images, I simply applied 5*5 gaussian blur for convenience.
